## What is this?

ImagicalMine is software for hosting Minecraft : Pocket Edition servers. From controlling everything you can possibly do on MCPE to everything players can ever imagine on a server, ImagicalMine is the perfect solution to hosting large-scale MCPE servers. Our goal is to make ImagicalMine the best MCPE server software out there, and can handle up to 1000 players without lag.

It'll stay free forever and the team will try and keep it active as well as possible.
